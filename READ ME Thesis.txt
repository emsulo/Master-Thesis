TO BE OPENED IN AN R-Project NAMED "Thesis"!

--- 0_Functions_Thesis.R ---
- Functions needed for 1_Optimizations_Large.R and 1_Optimizations_Finite.R
  . Intercept needed to obtain target treatment proportion in deviation popn. 
     Large:	d_p_l = c(0.1, 0.5, 0.9)  
     Finite:d_p = c(0.1,0.15, 0.5, 0.55, 0.9, 0.95)
	loss_function_intercept()
	intercept_optim()
    comments in the file for details on defaults, input, and output

  . Parameters to obtain a target: 
     Large: AUC = 0.8, outcome proportion = 0.5,
     Finite: AUC = 0.8, outcome proportion = 0.2, 
    parameters of all predictors are constrained to be the same
	AUC_grid()
    comments in the file for details on defaults, input, and output

- Function needed for 2_Simulation_Large.R and 2_Simulation_Finite.R
  . Simulation study including generating the data, fitting the models,
    getting performance measure results 
	my_sim()
    comments in the file for details on defaults, input, and output

	target: treatment proportion of the respective (derivation) scenario
	save as "res_intercept_large.RData" in Results sub-folder
- Tuning parameters for targeted AUC and outcome proportion LARGE scenario 	
	target: AUC = 0.8, outcome proportion = 0.5
	save as "res_AUC_large.RData" in Results sub-folder


--- 1_Optimization_Finite.R --- (TAKES A LONG TIME TO RUN)
- Optimizing intercept to obtain treatment proportion for FINITE scenario
	target: treatment proportion of the respective (derivation) scenario
	save as "res_intercept_finite.RData" in Results sub-folder
- Tuning parameters for targeted AUC and outcome proportion FINITE scenario 	
	target: AUC = 0.8, outcome proportion = 0.2
	save as "res_AUC_finite.RData" in Results sub-folder



--- 2_Simulation_Large.R --- (TAKES A LONG TIME TO RUN)
- Obtaining Simulation results using the results 
	"res_AUC_large.RData" and "res_intercept_large.RData" from the Results folder
	obtained by running 1_Optimizations_Large.R 
- Running simulation for T depending on P
	save as "res_sim_large.RData" in the Results sub-folder


--- 2_Simulation_Finite.R --- (TAKES A LONG TIME TO RUN)
- Obtaining Simulation results using the results 
	"res_AUC_finite.RData" and "res_intercept_finite.RData" from the Results folder
	obtained by running 1_Optimizations_Finite.R 
- Running simulation for T depending on P
	save as "res_sim_finite.RData" in the Results sub-folder


--- 3_Result_Processing_Large.R ---
- Code for creating plots using the results 
	"res_sim_large" in the Results subfolder 
	obtained by running 2_Simulation_Large.R 
- 1) First overview, descriptives across all scenarios 
- 2) Result processing and saving it under res_large_processed.RData




--- 3_Result_Processing_Finite.R ---
- Code for creating plots using the results 
	"res_sim_finite" in the Results subfolder 
	obtained by running 2_Simulation_Finite.R

- 1) First overview, descriptives across all scenarios
- 2) Result processing and saving under res_finite_processed.RData




--- 4_Plots_Report.R ---
- Plots included in the report (plots for constant proportion/effect size
  for Calibration-in-the-large Coefficient and Calibration Slope
- saved under Plots ending in _val.pdf



--- 5_Appendix_Plots ---
- Code to recreate the plots in the appendix
- saved under Plots ending in _abs.pdf for small (finite) 
  and _abs.png for large sample size


--- 6_Supplementary_Tables ---
- Code to generate the basic xtalbe output for LaTeX code used for the tables 
  in the Supplementary Materials
- resulting LaTeX code was manually adjusted for consistancy and readability purpose


--- 6_Visualization_App.Rmd ---
- Code for the Shiny App available at 
   https://emilialoescher.shinyapps.io/6_visualization_app/
- interactive loopplots
