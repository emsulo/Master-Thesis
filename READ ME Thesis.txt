TO BE OPENED IN AN R-Project NAMED "Thesis" and RAN IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER:

--- 0_Functions_Thesis.R ---
- Functions needed for 1_Optimizations_Large.R and 1_Optimizations_Finite.R
  . Intercept needed to obtain target treatment proportion in deviation popn. 
     Large:	d_p_l = c(0.1, 0.5, 0.9)  
     Finite:d_p = c(0.1,0.15, 0.5, 0.55, 0.9, 0.95)
	loss_function_intercept()
	intercept_optim()

  . Parameters to obtain a target: 
     Large: c-statistic = 0.8, outcome proportion = 0.5,
     Finite: c-statistic = 0.8, outcome proportion = 0.2, 
    parameters of all predictors are constrained to be the same
	AUC_grid()


- Function needed for 2_Simulation_Large.R and 2_Simulation_Finite.R
  . Simulation study including generating the data, fitting the models,
    getting performance measure results 
	my_sim()

- Code for creating plots using the results 
	"res_sim_large" in the Results sub-folder 
	obtained by running 2_Simulation_Large.R
